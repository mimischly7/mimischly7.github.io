### Idea (round #1):
  Translate the grid of 0's and 1's (representing water and land, respectively) into an undirected bicolored graph - where white corresponds to 0 (water) and black represents to 1 (land). This would require producing to sets, `V` (for the notes) and `E` (for the edges). Then, given the graph structure, we can run BFS on each water node to find the nearest land node.




``` python
# BFS search from my recollection

V = {nodes}
E = {edges}

Q = {empty queue}
Q.enqueue(v)


while Q is not empty:
  val = Q.dequeue(v)
  for n in v.neighbours:
    if n.color == W:
      Q.enqueue(n)
      n.p = val


###########################################

Q = {empty queue}
Q.enqueue(v)

dist = 0
while Q is not empty:
  dist += 1
  val = Q.dequeue(v)
  for n in v.neighbours:
    if n.land = true:
      return dist
    if n.color == W:
      Q.enqueue(n)
return -1


```

Notes:
  - I decided to make a Node class to encapculate information, especially the distance (so that to increment the `d` of a node during the BFS you do
    `parent.d + 1`). **I could not think of a way to globally track the distance (i.e. during the BFS,
      without making it an attribute of each node), to know, at any point during the BFS, at what distance you are standing**.
